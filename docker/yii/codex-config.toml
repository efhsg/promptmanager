# Codex CLI configuration for Docker container
# This file is mounted read-only over ~/.codex/config.toml to avoid
# host-specific settings (e.g., MCP_DOCKER) causing warnings.
#
# Sandbox is disabled at config level because Docker containers
# typically lack Landlock/seccomp support required by the Codex sandbox.
# The Docker container itself provides the isolation boundary.
