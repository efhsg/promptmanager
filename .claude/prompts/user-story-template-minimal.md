# User Story Template (Minimal)

Minimal version — just enough for the analyst to start. For the full template, see `user-story-template.md`.

---

**As a** {role},
**I want to** {action},
**so that** {benefit}.

## What should happen

{Describe the desired behavior. Numbered steps for a flow, or a short paragraph for simple changes.}

## What should NOT happen

{Anything explicitly out of scope, or leave blank.}

## Open questions

{List unknowns — the analyst will investigate. Leave blank if none.}

---

Hand to the analyst with: `Run Phase 1 on this user story. Design dir: .claude/design/{feature-name}/`
