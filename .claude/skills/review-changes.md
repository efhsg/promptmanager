# ReviewChanges

Perform a structured code review of staged or unstaged changes against project rules and best practices.

## Persona

Senior PHP 8.2 developer with Yii2 expertise. Familiar with PromptManager domain: prompt management system, Quill Delta JSON for rich text, placeholder system (GEN/PRJ/EXT), project linking.

## When to Use

- User asks to review changes, code, or a PR
- Before finalizing changes for commit
- After implementing a feature to catch issues early

## Inputs

- `scope`: Optional file path, directory, or description to narrow review
- `staged`: If true, review only staged changes (default: review all changes)

## Outputs

- Summary with file count and overall status
- Findings categorized by severity
- Actionable recommendations

## Review Phases

### Phase 1: Defect Detection

Run this phase first. Fix all Critical/High/Medium issues before proceeding to Phase 2.

#### 1. Correctness

- Logic is correct and handles edge cases
- No obvious bugs or regressions
- Error handling is appropriate (no silent failures)

#### 2. Style & Standards

Per `.claude/rules/coding-standards.md`, plus:

- No `declare(strict_types=1)`
- Full type hints on params/returns/properties
- `use` imports, no inline FQCNs
- No typed public properties for AR DB columns
- Docblocks only for `@throws` or Yii2 magic
- Prefer early returns over deep nesting
- No commented-out code
- No unnecessary curly braces

#### 3. Architecture

Per `.claude/rules/architecture.md`, plus:

- Complex queries belong in Query classes (`models/query/`)
- Config values via `Yii::$app->params`, not hardcoded
- Controllers delegate to services
- Services < 300 lines

#### 4. PromptManager Domain

- Correct user ownership validation via RBAC rules
- Quill Delta JSON handled correctly
- Placeholder parsing (GEN:, PRJ:, EXT:) follows patterns
- Project linking respects access controls

#### 5. Security

Per `.claude/rules/security.md`:

- Owner verification on all operations
- Input validation via model rules
- No PII in logs
- Parameterized queries (via ActiveRecord)

#### 6. Tests

Per `.claude/rules/testing.md`:

- New behavior has tests
- Test naming follows pattern
- Mocks via constructor injection

**Note:** Test execution happens in `/finalize-changes`, not here. This phase only checks test coverage and structure.

#### 7. Frontend/UI

When views, layouts, CSS, or JS files are changed:

- **Responsive design:** Navbar collapses appropriately, no wrapping/overflow at breakpoints
- **Bootstrap classes:** Correct use of responsive utilities (`d-none`, `d-*-inline`, `navbar-expand-*`)
- **CSS media queries:** Match Bootstrap breakpoints (sm:576, md:768, lg:992, xl:1200, xxl:1400)
- **Form elements:** Inputs and buttons usable at all viewport sizes

### Phase 2: Design Refinement

Run only after Phase 1 has no Critical/High/Medium findings. Apply judiciously — stop when goal is met.

#### SOLID Principles

- **S**ingle Responsibility: Does each class have one reason to change?
- **O**pen/Closed: Can behavior be extended without modifying existing code?
- **L**iskov Substitution: Are subtypes substitutable for their base types?
- **I**nterface Segregation: Are interfaces small and focused?
- **D**ependency Inversion: Do classes depend on abstractions, not concretions?

#### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Is there duplicated logic that should be extracted?
- Are there repeated patterns that warrant a shared abstraction?

#### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

- Is there speculative code that isn't currently used?
- Are there abstractions without multiple implementations?
- Is there over-engineering for hypothetical future requirements?

#### Code Conventions

- Consistent naming patterns across related classes
- Consistent parameter ordering in similar methods
- Balanced abstraction levels within the same layer

## Algorithm

### Phase 1 Algorithm

1. Run `git status --porcelain` to identify changed files
2. Run `git diff` (or `git diff --staged`) to see specific changes
3. Read each changed file to understand full context
4. Load project rules from `.claude/rules/`
5. Evaluate each file against Phase 1 checklist
6. Categorize findings by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
7. Report findings — stop here if Critical/High/Medium issues exist

**Note:** Test execution happens in `/finalize-changes`, not during review.

### Phase 2 Algorithm

Only run after Phase 1 issues are resolved:

1. Re-read changed files with design lens
2. Evaluate against SOLID/DRY/YAGNI principles
3. Check code conventions for consistency
4. Report refinement suggestions as Low severity
5. Compile final report with all recommendations

## Severity Levels

| Level | Criteria | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Critical** | Security vulnerabilities, data corruption risks, breaking changes without migration | Must fix before merge |
| **High** | Bugs, incorrect logic, missing error handling, violated architecture rules | Should fix before merge |
| **Medium** | Missing tests, code style violations, suboptimal patterns | Recommended to fix |
| **Low** | Minor improvements, documentation gaps, naming suggestions | Consider fixing |

## Output Format

```
## Review Summary

**Files reviewed:** N files
**Phase:** 1 (Defect Detection) | 2 (Design Refinement)
**Status:** PASS | PASS WITH COMMENTS | NEEDS CHANGES

## Phase 1 Findings

### Critical
- (none or list with file:line references)

### High
- `path/to/file:123` — description of issue

### Medium
- `path/to/file:45` — description of issue

### Low
- `path/to/file:67` — suggestion

## Phase 2 Findings (if applicable)

### Refinement
- `path/to/file:89` — SOLID/DRY/YAGNI suggestion

## Recommendations

1. Specific action to take
2. ...
```

**Note:** If Phase 1 has Critical/High/Medium findings, do not proceed to Phase 2. Report Phase 1 findings and recommend fixes first.

## Next Step

If the review status is **PASS** or **PASS WITH COMMENTS** (no Critical/High/Medium findings):
- Suggest: "Ready to finalize? Run `/finalize-changes` to lint, test, and prepare the commit."

## Definition of Done

- All changed files reviewed against Phase 1 checklist
- Findings reference specific file and line numbers
- Each finding has clear, actionable description
- Overall status reflects severity of findings
- Phase 2 only runs when Phase 1 has no Critical/High/Medium issues
- Output follows the required format
