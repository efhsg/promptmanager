# PromtpManager: Automate Your AI Prompts

Welcome to **PromtpManager**, a new software project dedicated to streamlining your work with AI prompt engineering. We recognized a common challenge in the development processâ€”managing and assembling various parts of prompts stored in loose text files through manual copy-and-paste. PromtpManager is here to change that.

## What Is PromtpManager?

PromtpManager is designed to automate the creation, management, and integration of prompts used in large language model (LLM) software development. Our tool leverages a structured approach using a combination of projects, contexts, and prompt templates with customizable fields, ensuring that your prompts are both organized and dynamically assembled as needed.

## Why PromtpManager?

- **Efficiency:** Eliminate the tedious process of manually piecing together prompt components.
- **Automation:** Seamlessly manage and update your prompts with an automated system.
- **Organization:** Keep your projects, contexts, and templates in one centralized repository.

Explore the complete source code and join the development at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/efhsg/promptmanager).
